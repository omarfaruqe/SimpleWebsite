        Dhaka has officially requested the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to repatriate its nationals from war-torn Yemen. "We are sending two officers tomorrow from Oman to Djibouti, who will then travel to Eden [Aden], Yemen and help verify/identify Bangladeshi nationals and issue necessary travel document, if needed, to help them to be on board in a ship," he posted on his official Facebook page.

        Around 1,500-3,000 Bangladeshis remain in the conflict zone of Yemen, but most of them are in Aden which is apparently a safer place, Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque told reporters yesterday. Dhaka on Monday declared its support to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition which launched air strikes against Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen on March 26 after the rebels took control of large parts of the Arab country. Talking to newsmen after a press conference, Shahidul said Dhaka has also urged New Delhi to help repatriate Bangladeshis.

        The government has taken effective measures to ensure they return home safe and sound, he added. India in principle agreed to assist Bangladesh, but it depends on the availability of space in ships as the country is sending vessels to Yemen to rescue its citizens, he noted. Meanwhile, the Indian High Commission in Dhaka in a statement on its official Twitter account yesterday said India would assist in the evacuation of Bangladeshis from Yemen.

        The government has taken effective measures to ensure they return home safe and sound, he added.As there is no visible rescue plan in sight, the stranded Bangladeshis are worried about their fate. Aman Ullah, who works for a World Bank project in Sana, wrote on his Facebook wall, “We are now in a crucial situation here. We can't move from our residences due to fighting between different groups. We need emergency rescue support.”

        Later last night, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam said on Facebook that Bangladesh would send two officials to Yemen to facilitate the repatriation process. The other countries are evacuating their nationals as the situation in Yemen is worsening by the day, he added. Another Bangladeshi Jahirul Islam Bulbul wrote, “We can't sleep safely. Every night seems to be our last night. India, Pakistan and other embassies have already evacuated their people. But we are still suffering from insecurity.” Two Bangladeshi engineers have been stranded in two hotels in Saana for last one week as there is no flight from the Yemeni capital to Dhaka.
